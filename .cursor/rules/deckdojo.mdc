# What is the app?
 This app is a tool for TCG (at the current time Yu-Gi-Oh) players. The name is deckdojo and the main idea is to provide a tool to the players to create decks, track their games, gather news and statistics.



# Style
- The whole app should resamble a dojo so it should adhere to dojo like wordings and contian some asian Lore/Mythology
- The app should be designed in a pixel game art style
- All tools and areas should have a gamification factor to them
- The app logo is a Dragon
- The main colors are:
--main-blue: #11465d;
--bright-gold: #fcdd5a;
- [global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css)
- A dark mode should be allways available
- Each tool e.g. deck builder should be called with a dojo esque name -> Arsenal is the deck builder to "prep your weapons"
- Each tool should use some tool specific accent color. If no color is specified within the [global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css), define it there and refence it.
- The background of each tool should be an pixel art that scales between screen sizes.
- The app should be created with a mobile first approach, differentiating beween mobile and non mobile screen sizes e.g. when creating a menu. Allways use for that state of the art approaches for mobile web-apps

# Techology and Structure
- The app is a React web-app
- A mobile version is thought of but not yet in production
- general project structure, key functions etc. should be documented within [README.md](mdc:README.md), also use this for reference
- Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) when something is outdated.
